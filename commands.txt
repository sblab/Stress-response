To calculate adjusted p-values using the formula adj p-value = p-value * m / i:

1. Determine the total number of hypotheses tested (m).
   - Count the total number of p-values in the dataset.

2. Sort the p-values in ascending order.
   - Assign ranks to each p-value based on this sorted order (i = rank).

3. Calculate the adjusted p-values.
   - For each p-value, compute the adjusted p-value using the formula:
     adj p-value = p-value * m / i
   - Replace i with the rank of the respective p-value.





To calculate log₂FC (log fold change):

1. Obtain FPKM values for two conditions.
   - Identify the FPKM (Fragments Per Kilobase Million) values for Condition 1 and Condition 

2. Compute the logarithms of FPKM values.
   - Calculate log₂(FPKMCondition 2) and log₂(FPKMCondition 1).

3. Subtract the logarithms.
   - Use the formula:
     log₂FC = log₂(FPKMCondition 2) − log₂(FPKMCondition 1)


To analyze protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks:
1. Extract differentially expressed genes (DEGs).
   - Use predefined criteria such as fold change and statistical significance.

2. Upload the protein list to STRING database.
   - Go to https://string-db.org/ and select the 'Multiple Proteins' tab.
   - Paste the protein list into the input box and select the specific organism.
   - Apply a confidence score threshold of >0.775.
   - Construct and visualize the PPI network based on these parameters.

3. Export and import networks to Cytoscape.
   - Export networks from STRING and import them into Cytoscape for further analysis.

4. Merge networks in Cytoscape.
   - Steps to merge:
     1. Go to File > Import > Network > File and import the individual networks you want to merge.
     2. Repeat this step for each network. The networks will appear as separate entries in the Network Panel.
     3. Navigate to Tools > Merge > Networks to open the Network Merge dialog box.
     4. Select the networks you want to merge from the list of imported networks.
